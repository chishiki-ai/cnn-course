    "## Multi node motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous parts, we learned that training deep learning models with multiple GPUs is critical as the number of parameters for neural networks grow. The same logic of using more compute resource to speed things up motivates us to scale further up beyond resources on one node or one machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn about multi node training, let's first review some notions from previous part of the tutorial.\n",

    "*Login vs Compute Nodes*\n",
    "\n",
    "HPC centers, like TACC, host several supercomputers. Supercomputers, or computer clusters, are a group of interconnected computers such that they can act like a single machine. The various computers that make up the computer cluster are nodes which come in two types: login and compute. Login nodes are those that you interact with in logging on to our machines via SSH and are used for routine task like modifying and organizing files. Compute nodes are where the actual calculations are done and what we will utilize to parallelize the training of neural networks. A GPU node typically consists of multiple GPUs. \n",

    "## Review PyTorch DDP\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previouse notebook, we have done distributed training with PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP) on multiple GPUs residing on one node. DDP can also run across multiple nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "DDP uses collective communications in the torch.distributed package to synchronize gradients and buffers. More specifically, DDP registers an autograd [hook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syLFCVYua6Q) for each parameter given by model.parameters() and the hook will fire when the corresponding gradient is computed in the backward pass. Then DDP uses that signal to trigger gradient synchronization across processes.\n",

    "*Overview of DDP training. Each process independently loads and processes a batch of data and synchronizes local gradients with others through a gradient aggregation process which requires global communications.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind DDP is following - we create processes that replicate a job for multiple times. PyTorch DDP uses `torch.distributed.init_process_group` method to set up a process group, and distributes data amongst processes with DistributedSampler. It also prepares model impletation with DDP wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are introduced to some environment variables that glue the training environment together: WORLD_SIZE, GLOBAL_RANK and LOCAL_RANK. They are fancy names for \"total number of GPUs in your job\", \"the ID for the GPU in your cluster\" and \"the local ID for the GPU in a node\". \n",
